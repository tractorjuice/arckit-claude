name: G-Cloud Framework Questions
description: "Answers quick questions about the Digital Marketplace question structure for a G-Cloud submission: character and word limits, how many features and benefits, lot 1, 2 and 3 categories, the service and declaration questions CCS asks, pricing format and mandatory exclusion grounds. Not needed when the request is for the submission content itself; /arckit-uk-gcloud:service-design, pricing, declaration and the sdd-lot commands write that."

# G-Cloud Framework Questions

Conversational knowledge about Crown Commercial Service (CCS) framework questions, character limits, lot categories, and declaration requirements for G-Cloud submissions.

## Purpose

## When to Use

Activate when users ask about:

- Character or word limits for specific fields
- How many features, benefits, or categories are allowed
- What lots exist and their categories
- Declaration requirements and exclusion grounds
- Pricing question structure
- Any "how many" or "what limit" question about G-Cloud fields

## Quick Reference: Common Limits

| Lot 3 | Cloud Support | 6 (Planning, Setup & migration, QA & testing, Security, Training, Ongoing support) |

## Quick Reference: Declaration

The declaration has ~57 questions across these areas:

- **Mandatory exclusion grounds** (7 questions) — criminal convictions, tax evasion; must answer "No" to pass
- **Discretionary exclusion grounds** (11 questions) — bankruptcy, misconduct, misrepresentation
- **Modern slavery** (4 questions) — required for suppliers with turnover above threshold
- **Insurance** — employers liability minimum £5m
- **Framework agreement** (~19 questions) — T&Cs acceptance, service type, subcontracting

## Answering Questions

When answering framework questions:

1. **Check the quick reference tables above first** for common lookups (limits, lots, categories)
2. **Consult `references/framework-questions.md`** for the full question structure including question IDs, types, and which lots each question applies to
3. **Be specific about lot applicability** — many questions only apply to Lots 1 & 2 (hosting/software) and not Lot 3 (support), or vice versa
4. **Note that limits are strictly enforced** — the Digital Marketplace rejects submissions exceeding character/word limits
