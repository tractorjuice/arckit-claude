# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Adds `--diagram-format mermaid|plantuml` to `/arckit-repo:repo-audit`, selecting the syntax of the as-built C4 container diagram (#706)
- Mermaid remains the default: an audit is normally read in the repository it audits, where GitHub, GitLab and ArcKit Pages render it inline with no toolchain, while PlantUML needs a server, the VS Code extension, or ArcKit Pages
- `--diagram-format plantuml` emits C4-PlantUML, which lays out large container diagrams better and supports directional hints (`Lay_D`, `Lay_R`) that matter above roughly ten containers
- Accepts `puml` / `c4-plantuml` and `mmd` as synonyms; an unrecognised value warns and falls back to Mermaid rather than aborting the audit
- Check mode (`--check` / `--dry-run`) now reports the resolved diagram format
- `codebase-audit-template.md` documents which format it uses and how to change it permanently via `.arckit/templates-custom/`, which the command already reads first

## 1.1.0 (2026-07-27)

- Adds `/arckit-repo:repo-audit` for auditing a codebase against architecture principles and requirements (#616)
- Accepts a local path, a public GitHub or GitLab URL, or the current repository; remote targets are shallow-cloned to a temporary directory after confirmation and deleted afterwards
- Two automatically inferred modes: conformance (scores the codebase against PRIN/REQ artefacts) and cold (standalone as-built audit). Degrades rather than erroring when prerequisites are thin
- Writes a `CDAU` Codebase Audit artefact to `projects/{PID}-{name}/audits/`, multi-instance so one project can audit several repositories
- Findings carry both severity and confidence (Verified / Inferred / Absent), and undocumented decisions are emitted as ready-to-file ADR stubs
- Never executes code from the audited repository, never writes a secret value into the report, and never writes into the audited repo
- Private repositories are out of scope; clone locally and audit the path instead
- Plugin is no longer exempt from the shared-asset sync, so it now carries `templates/_partials/` and `references/` for the Document Control header

## 1.0.0 (2026-07-04)

- Initial release
- Adds `/arckit-repo:repo-docs` for source-grounded, agent-readable repository documentation
- Writes repository docs under `docs/repository/`
- Uses OpenWiki-inspired targeted discovery, git-history-aware updates, temporary planning, source references, and secret avoidance
